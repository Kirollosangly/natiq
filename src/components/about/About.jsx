                        1. <span className='fw-semibold'>Input and Pronunciation:</span> Natiq offers a user-friendly interface where you can easily input any Arabic word.
                        Once entered, our advanced AI voice technology instantly translates the word into clear, accurate, and authentic pronunciation.
                        Hear the word come to life in a way that mirrors native speech patterns.

                        2. <span className='fw-semibold'>Echo Effect:</span> But we've taken it a step further. Natiq doesn't just pronounce the word;
                        it reinforces learning through repetition. After enunciating the word, Natiq employs its unique "echo" feature, where the last word is echoed three times.
                        This helps etch the pronunciation into your memory, enhancing your linguistic recall and fluency.
