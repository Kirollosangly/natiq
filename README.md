### Natiq - RDI Web Application

Natiq is a web application designed to enhance your language learning experience. With the power of dvanced AI voice technology, our app allows you to input Arabic words, instantly transforming them into clear and accurate vocalizations. But that's not all â€“ we've added a unique twist! After pronouncing the word, our app provides an engaging echo feature, where the last word is repeated three times in succession.
